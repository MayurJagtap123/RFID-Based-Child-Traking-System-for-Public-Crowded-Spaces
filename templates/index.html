            <h2 style="color: black">Kumbh Mela</h2>
            <p style="color: #00544a;">The Kumbh Mela is a major religious event in India, drawing millions of devotees to take part in sacred rituals along the banks of rivers like the Ganges. The event spans over several days and takes place in four locations: Allahabad (Prayagraj), Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain, with a vast congregation of people, including families with children. Due to the overwhelming crowd size, there is a significant risk of children becoming separated from their parents, making it essential to implement systems that can assist in quickly locating and reuniting lost children.</p>
            <p style="color: #00544a;">Child tracking systems using technologies like RFID tags, GPS wristbands, and mobile applications can greatly enhance child safety at Kumbh Mela. These systems can help authorities track children's movements in real time, send alerts to parents if their child is lost, and assist in locating them using a centralized database. The integration of AI-powered surveillance cameras, emergency alert systems, and public registration points ensures that children are quickly located and reunited with their families, making the Kumbh Mela experience safer for everyone involved.</p>
